# Moodbook

### About Moodbook

Moodbook is a powerful, highly customizable and secure personal journal that doubles up as a mood/event tracker.

### Features

Moodbook is built around a system of descriptive tags named "moods" that can be assigned to journal entries. Each journal entry corresponds to a single date and contains an editable text block. Moodbook allows you to

- Create, delete, merge and retroactively edit moods
- Quickly filter and read previews of journal entries using moods, month and year
- Export your journal entries in JSON format
- View all time Moodbook stats
- Delete your journal data or your user account if needed

Moodbook's personalizable mood system allows you to keep track of important life events, daily moods and pretty much anything you'd like to. Need to view exactly when you got paid each month last year? Or perhaps the number of dates you went on this year and read excerpts from your journal entry about each? Moodbook's got your back! :)
